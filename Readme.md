# Gpt-Console

A naked look at as how *Chat-GPT* responds to a given arbitrary input string.

You will need to set the environment variable *OPENAI_API_KEY* to be your private key for this to work.

## Notes

* Thia is a raw first pass. The idea was to get as bare to the bones as possible, so it takes some parsing to grok the output.
* You get far more information from this than you do via the web interface.
* This also works in Unity3d.

## TODO

* Using Json formatting for output. I don't want to remove any information; just make it easier t o parse.
